--Example SQL Queries from Last Class

/* 
Unfortunately, we didn't get to go as deep as I would have liked in our last session. 
I thought class was going to end at 4 so there would be ample time to get back to the 
exploratory data analysis. I'll share a series of SQL queries to help you look at the 
data some more on your own. I'll also share queries on a another data set 
(citibike trips) for you to see how we could gather additional insights from event 
data. I highly recommend running these queries and examining the results when you 
have an opportunity. You'll find some interesting trends in the most popular rides 
in New York, which likely correlates with the capacity issues we were discussing. 

Please note that there are subtle differences in the syntax (because of Google 
BigQuery) and that there are some more advanced methods in here that arenâ€™t covered 
in the class. */
